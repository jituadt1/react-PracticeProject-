# react-PracticeProject-
This project demonstrates my skills in react. It is a simple beginner project but it gave me very deep understanding of how react works and what are its features. 
I used number of components to demonstrate "Encapsulation" and "Modularization".  Also, in my editor I used number extension to make it easier to code. 

Editor : VS Code (Visual Studio Code)

Extension I used: Prettier, Simple React Snippets 

Libraries: Bootstrap, Font-Awesome
